# About the Fable compiler project. Goals & perspective.

## Foreword

Initiated by [Alfonso Garcia Caro](https://github.com/alfonsogarciacaro) in 2016, the Fable project federates developers from very different fields to allow the use of F# in JavaScript projects.

Fable wouldn't be what it is without the efforts of its community who gather here and there every few months during conferences and workshops. The project is the result of a true Open Source mind set: partnership, pragmatism, creativity, sharing and having fun!
