# About the Fable compiler project. Goals & perspective.

## Foreword

Initiated by [Alfonso Garcia Caro](https://github.com/alfonsogarciacaro) in 2016, the Fable project federates developers from very different fields, research, finance, Iot, to allow the F# in JavaScript projects.

### Community?
Fable wouldn't be what it is without the efforts of its community who gather here and there every few months during conferences and workshops.

### Open source?
The project is the result of a true Open Source mind set: partnership, pragmatism, creativity, sharing and having fun!

### Business ready?
And of course, since Fable creators use it every day in their production environments, what you're going to discover is a bullet-proof solution and ready for whatever JS project you've got in mind.

### Free?
Well since the major part of the development is done by people making a living using Fable, no need ask for money.

### Modern?
Fable compiler outputs your F# code to ES6 JavaScript. ES6 is the de facto industry standard.

We hope you'll enjoy our if-it-compiles-it-works motto!
