# Build & Run

Your project is ready? Then it's time to build and run your project.

Depending on the template you've chosen, build options may differ. Since the JavaScript ecosystem offers many different tools, they may differ according to the needs of a project. Please refer to the README file for the chosen template to get more information.

In most case building a project will imply `yarn build` and running a project will imply `yarn start`

What's the difference?
- `build` generates the .js files
- `start` will allow you to run a temporary version that will watch changes and reload accordingly.

The available targets are listed in the `package.json` at the root of your project directory.
